## Project Overview
**Python Car Game** is a lane-based arcade-style driving game developed using Pygame. The player must avoid oncoming cars and shoot bullets to destroy them while progressing through increasingly challenging levels. The game features dynamic difficulty, responsive controls, collision detection, and a retro car sound for immersion.

## Features
- ðŸŽ® Smooth player movement using arrow keys or A/D.
- ðŸš— Enemies spawn in multiple lanes and increase with levels.
- ðŸ”« Bullet firing mechanism to destroy enemy cars.
- ðŸ’¥ Collision detection and game over screen.
- ðŸŸ¢ Dynamic level progression.
- ðŸ”Š Background engine sound (looped via pygame.mixer).
- ðŸŽ¨ Basic graphics and animations using pygame.Surface and sprites.

## Game Mechanics
- **Player Car**: Moves left/right within the defined road lanes.
- **Enemy Cars**: Move downward and respawn when destroyed or passed.
- **Bullets**: The player can shoot up to 10 bullets per level. Bullets collide with enemy cars to remove them.
- **Leveling**: Player advances to the next level after reaching a certain score.
- **Game Over**: Triggered on collision with an enemy car.
